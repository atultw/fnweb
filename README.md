# fnweb

Right now this is just a small exploration of how functional concepts might be applied in a web framework. It could
become the underlying code for an upcoming product of mine though ðŸ¤”

Features I like:
* error handling pattern
* no global variables
* modular "components"

Areas for improvement (potentially will fix):
* function chaining pattern may not be worth the overhead in its current form
* have to memorize order of args or use an IDE with type annotations

Stay tuned!

Roadmap:

* Finish coding
* Organize the code
* Document
